* Replicate the style of Lukes designs
    * Make the position/name column sticky
    * Fonts & formatting
-------
* Additional content
    * Reference control-code when assigning column, sometimes controls get missed
    * Calculate 'time behind' based on the current fastest time (- Time behind column for overall   ie.  +00:08  calculated off the fastest time.  The fastest time will change during the event depending on when finishers come in so this probably needs to check for changes regularly.)
        * Should show this for each split
    * Control Number next to split number in the heading column.  Xml reference <ControlCode>.   if <ControlCode> is equal to 999  display text ‘Finish’
    * Club added.   in XML its under <Organisation>  and then display the <Name>

* Ability to favourite


Stretch:
* Placing at each split (nice to have, see liveresults at screenshot, favouriting is preferred)
* Ability to read a start list xml file before results are displayed.  Currently the server just gets confused if there is a startlist.xml in the folder.  This is important as its the only way to get a list of starters in the website.. otherwise we have to wait until the competitors first time comes through.
    * Either add basic parsing, or ignore the file
* Relay events (big stretch)
